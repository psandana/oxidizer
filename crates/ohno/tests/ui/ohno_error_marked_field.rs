//! `#[ohno::error]` always adds the `OhnoCore` field and always generates the error representation
//! from it, so a marker on another field asks for something the attribute cannot honour.
//!
//! Declaring a field of type `OhnoCore` is fine: the injected field is the marked one, so the
//! declared field stays an ordinary field.
